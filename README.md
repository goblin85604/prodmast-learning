# Prodmast

This is a personal project created to help me learn and improve my web development skills.  
The design and layout are **not my own** â€” Iâ€™m recreating an existing project I found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/24788574-Prodmast-Manufacturing-Landing-Page), using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

I'm not affiliated with the original creator in any way. This is a non-commercial, educational exercise to practice building modern web interfaces based on visual references (screenshots and video provided in the original post).
